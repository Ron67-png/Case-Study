## __Ethical Issues__
### __Privacy__
* Issue: When a computer receives data it can be easily copied or transmitted and on mobile phones some applications request permissions to access to sensitive data.

* Impact: Puts your personal data at risk which can lead to identity theft and some organizations potentially can monitor a individual without knowing.

* Current Response: Any Organization that stores private data should ensure that the data remains private and the Data Protection Act ensures that organizations comply with law regarding data privacy.
#
### __Spread of Misinformation__
* Issue: News and Information on the internet have chances of being non-validated news and Deepfake technology allows people to be easily manipulated making it difficult to trust visual content

* Impact: Can cause confusion and fear in society and false information can influence public opinion aswell as political decisions   

* Current Response: Created policies and regulations focused on misinformation and deepfake misuse and some social media platforms are adopting fact checking tools and content moderation systems.
#
### __Artificial Intelligence Bias & Accountability__
* Issue: AI introduces significant ethical concerns such as facial recognition and health tracking tools putting personal data at risk and there is also a possibility of misuse of sensitive information collected by AI systems.

* Impact: Heightens the risk of privacy violations, unauthorised data use and identity tracking which leads to potential discrimination in places such as hiring, law enforcement and healthcare.

* Current Response: Created guidelines focused on transparency and accountability, including the introduction of the GDPR which requires the organization to protect user information and the research in bias detection and bias reduction technique in machine learning systems.

## __Proposed Improvements__

### __Ethical Enhancement 1:__ Implement practices for data privacy
* Data minimization - Only collect and process necessary personal data that serves a purpose which reduces the amount of unnecessary data collected to reduce privacy risks.

* Control - Give users the ability to control, delete personal data as well as giving a option to deny consent for the use of their personal data.

* Data Security - Use strong security measures such as encryption, secure data storage to protect personal data from unauthorized access. 
#
### __Ethical Enhancement 2:__ Full Transparency & Accountability
* Clarity - Organization should explain to users clearly how the algorithm works, what data it relies on and decisions are made.

* Clear Responsibility - AI systems can make wrong decissions and can cause problems, Organizations should show who is responsible for all error correction and system maintenance.

* Audit Trails - Organizations will required to have regular auditing of their AI system to detect any sign of bias, security weakness or misuse of data. 
#
### __Ethical Enhancement 3:__ Reduce Misinformation Through Verification & Education
* Verification Tools - Improved automated fact checking tools which will labal unverified or manipulated content such as deepfakes.

* Digital Literacy Education - Show users how to evaluate sources, identify fake information and recognise deepfakes which can be done through school programs or online training.  

* Content Reporting System -  Enhance user reporting systems to be able to review false or harmful content which provides clear explanations to users.

# __Insights for Future Growth__
* __Create stronger ethical frameworks__ to support organizations in creating systems that transparent, fair and safe.

* __Collaborate more__ between governments, tech companies and researchers to assist the development of universal standards for digital and AI ethics.

* __Educate users__ about data privacy, cybersecurity and online risks which will support people to protect themselves and reduce the impact of fake news.

* __Continue to improve and monitor__ AI tools  which is important as technology continues to advance and new ethical risk arise.
