# The Development of the Internet Case Study

## Intro

### For our case study we have decided to focus on the devoplment of theiexploring the major events withins its history and its impacts within different aspects of the world and how its rapid devlopment changed the course of computing and connection forever

### We focused on three standpoints to view this, an engineering viewpoint, an enthical viewpoint and a social viewpoint. Looking on the foundations of the internet and its technogical evolution from an engineering viewpoint. Looking at the ethical issues with the internet and making proposals on how to help keep these issues under control. And looking at the impacts on soceity the internet has had over its long history.

### The devlopment the internet has had has made it one of the most innovative pieces of technology the world has ever created and this has solified itself has one the most important devices in the modern world and has reshaped a broad aspects of human life.

## Historical Timeline

### Timeline of Key Events

- 1969-1972:ARPANET's Creation and Public demonstration. The ARPANET was created and showcased to the public and its creation layed the foundation for modern networking as it was the start of having communication between two computers.
- 1983: Domain Name System: The creation of DNS simplified internet navigation brining us closer to the commerical use of the internet
- 1990:World Wide Web founded: Tim Berners-Lee wrote the code for the WWW which set the standard for HTML, HTTP and URl's
  Tim also shared the first photo this year on the internet.
- 1995: The WWW becomes used for commerical use: Online payments were created and with the beginning of eBay and Amazon this would mark when online shopping becoming more popular.
- 1997: Google: Google is launched as the first search based website.
- 1997: Creation of the Internet: Wireless interent is created boosting the abilites of computing through making everything wireless.

## THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE INTERNET

The internet as we know it is debatably the most significant engineering developments of the late 20th and 21st century. Practically anyone could tell you about the internet now, but lesser known is the long and detailed history of how it came to be, specifically the major engineering developments and struggles that it took to get the internet to where it is today. Some of these major leaps include things such as ARPANET and PACKET SWITCHING, TCP/IP, The Web, Wireless Networking and more.

## WHAT WAS ARPANET?

Developed in the late 1960s, ARAPNET was a US made system with the initial purpose of linking the computers of Pentagon funded institutions such as universities and other research/educational institutions.

Built from the wish to share information over distances without the need for connections using phone lines. This would ultimately require Packet-Switching. “Packets” are smaller groups of information broken into pieces from large messages. This was superior to traditional systems as it no longer needed dedicated pathways which were easily disrupted or damaged.

## THE INTRODUCTION OF TCP/IP

Developed in the 1970s by two people: Vint Cerf and Robert Kahn this system was a standard internet communications protocol that let computing expand to transfer data and messages over much longer distances than before. Based off packet switching where info is broken down and sent over different routes. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is what collects and then ultimately reassembles the previously broken up pieces of information. IP on the other hand is the part responsible for ensuring the broken-down pieces of information get sent to the right place. This system was eventually used in ARPANET in 1983.

## THE WORLD WIDE WEB

Arriving in 1989-1991, The World Wide Web was a computer engineering masterpiece for its time and remains as so to this very day. Developed by Tim Berners-Lee, the WWW was based off HTTP, HTML and URLs. This engineering marvel had solved the issue simple sharing of information across an array of systems. Using hyperlinks, these links allowed user to easily jump from one piece of media to the other by simply clicking on a highlighted phrase. Its adoption in the 90s started a massive engineering battle to expand and develop even better systems. Fiber optics came into use around the same time and Domain Name Systems (DNS) grew to handle the rapid demand of domain registrations. The massive spark caused by this pushed computer engineers to develop even better and stronger protocols.

## MOBILE INTERNET AND WIFI

Perhaps the one we are most familiar with now, and the one we rely on the most. WIFI allows for Local Area Networks (LANs) to work without the need for direct cable connections and wires. Which simply made life easier for anyone trying to connect, especially with the growing use of mobile phones. Which are of course meant to portable and therefore not wire to a router 24/7. The early 2000s saw the rise of massive data centers and global systems to hold, send, and receive data, while also being extremely reliable. This is when computing and data security also expanded, with data encryption and DDoS mitigation.

The internet is constantly growing at a shocking rate and will continue to expand for longer than we can possibly imagine. The engineering world and computing have always and will continue to work in tandem with one another, including things like satellite networks and cloud computing.

## **Ethical Issues**

### **Privacy**

- Issue: When a computer receives data it can be easily copied or transmitted and on mobile phones some applications request permissions to access to sensitive data.

- Impact: Puts your personal data at risk which can lead to identity theft and some organizations potentially can monitor a individual without knowing.

- Current Response: Any Organization that stores private data should ensure that the data remains private and the Data Protection Act ensures that organizations comply with law regarding data privacy.

#

### **Spread of Misinformation**

- Issue: News and Information on the internet have chances of being non-validated news and Deepfake technology allows people to be easily manipulated making it difficult to trust visual content

- Impact: Can cause confusion and fear in society and false information can influence public opinion aswell as political decisions

- Current Response: Created policies and regulations focused on misinformation and deepfake misuse and some social media platforms are adopting fact checking tools and content moderation systems.

#

### **Artificial Intelligence Bias & Accountability**

- Issue: AI introduces significant ethical concerns such as facial recognition and health tracking tools putting personal data at risk and there is also a possibility of misuse of sensitive information collected by AI systems.

- Impact: Heightens the risk of privacy violations, unauthorised data use and identity tracking which leads to potential discrimination in places such as hiring, law enforcement and healthcare.

- Current Response: Created guidelines focused on transparency and accountability, including the introduction of the GDPR which requires the organization to protect user information and the research in bias detection and bias reduction technique in machine learning systems.

#

## **Proposed Improvements**

### **Ethical Enhancement 1:** Implement practices for data privacy

- Data minimization - Only collect and process necessary personal data that serves a purpose which reduces the amount of unnecessary data collected to reduce privacy risks.

- Control - Give users the ability to control, delete personal data as well as giving a option to deny consent for the use of their personal data.

- Data Security - Use strong security measures such as encryption, secure data storage to protect personal data from unauthorized access.

#

### **Ethical Enhancement 2:** Full Transparency & Accountability

- Clarity - Organization should explain to users clearly how the algorithm works, what data it relies on and decisions are made.

- Clear Responsibility - AI systems can make wrong decissions and can cause problems, Organizations should show who is responsible for all error correction and system maintenance.

- Audit Trails - Organizations will required to have regular auditing of their AI system to detect any sign of bias, security weakness or misuse of data.

#

### **Ethical Enhancement 3:** Reduce Misinformation Through Verification & Education

- Verification Tools - Improved automated fact checking tools which will labal unverified or manipulated content such as deepfakes.

- Digital Literacy Education - Show users how to evaluate sources, identify fake information and recognise deepfakes which can be done through school programs or online training.

- Content Reporting System - Enhance user reporting systems to be able to review false or harmful content which provides clear explanations to users.

#

# **Insights for Future Growth**

- **Create stronger ethical frameworks** to support organizations in creating systems that transparent, fair and safe.

- **Collaborate more** between governments, tech companies and researchers to assist the development of universal standards for digital and AI ethics.

- **Educate users** about data privacy, cybersecurity and online risks which will support people to protect themselves and reduce the impact of fake news.

- **Continue to improve and monitor** AI tools which is important as technology continues to advance and new ethical risk arise.

## Conclusion

### The devolpment of the interenet shows how a single operation through the ARPANET has expanded to a worldwide system that is used by millions every second of every day. Through the engineering viewpoint we see the foundations of the internet and the different operations how they evolved as time went on. Through the ethical viewpoint we questioned some of the measures set it place in the intenret and how effective they are and ways to make the internet a better place by improving its ethics. And finally through the social viewpoint we looked at the advantages and disadvantages the internet has had on soceity as a whole.

### Through this case study we saw

- The engineering that went in to building the internet through many softwares
- How some areas of the internet need to be reworked to make it more ethical
- The impact the internet has has on soceity throughout different places and times

### As the internet is always evolving and improving itself to be more convient for commerical use we must come up with solutions to make it a more secure to place to be due to its global use. But its flaws does not effect its features and the global impact is undeniable. So overall its not perfect but it is always strving towards perfection.
