## THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE INTERNET
The internet as we know it is debatably the most significant engineering developments of the late 20th and 21st century. Practically anyone could tell you about the internet now, but lesser known is the long and detailed history of how it came to be, specifically the major engineering developments and struggles that it took to get the internet to where it is today. Some of these major leaps include things such as ARPANET and PACKET SWITCHING, TCP/IP, The Web, Wireless Networking and more. 

## WHAT WAS ARPANET?
Developed in the late 1960s, ARAPNET was a US made system with the initial purpose of linking the computers of Pentagon funded institutions such as universities and other research/educational institutions.

Built from the wish to share information over distances without the need for connections using phone lines. This would ultimately require Packet-Switching. “Packets” are smaller groups of information broken into pieces from large messages. This was superior to traditional systems as it no longer needed dedicated pathways which were easily disrupted or damaged. 

## THE INTRODUCTION OF TCP/IP
Developed in the 1970s by two people: Vint Cerf and Robert Kahn this system was a standard internet communications protocol that let computing expand to transfer data and messages over much longer distances than before. Based off packet switching where info is broken down and sent over different routes. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is what collects and then ultimately reassembles the previously broken up pieces of information. IP on the other hand is the part responsible for ensuring the broken-down pieces of information get sent to the right place. This system was eventually used in ARPANET in 1983.

## THE WORLD WIDE WEB
Arriving in 1989-1991, The World Wide Web was a computer engineering masterpiece for its time and remains as so to this very day. Developed by Tim Berners-Lee, the WWW was based off HTTP, HTML and URLs. This engineering marvel had solved the issue simple sharing of information across an array of systems. Using hyperlinks, these links allowed user to easily jump from one piece of media to the other by simply clicking on a highlighted phrase. Its adoption in the 90s started a massive engineering battle to expand and develop even better systems. Fiber optics came into use around the same time and Domain Name Systems (DNS) grew to handle the rapid demand of domain registrations. The massive spark caused by this pushed computer engineers to develop even better and stronger protocols. 

## MOBILE INTERNET AND WIFI
Perhaps the one we are most familiar with now, and the one we rely on the most. WIFI allows for Local Area Networks (LANs) to work without the need for direct cable connections and wires. Which simply made life easier for anyone trying to connect, especially with the growing use of mobile phones. Which are of course meant to portable and therefore not wire to a router 24/7. The early 2000s saw the rise of massive data centers and global systems to hold, send, and receive data, while also being extremely reliable. This is when computing and data security also expanded, with data encryption and DDoS mitigation. 

The internet is constantly growing at a shocking rate and will continue to expand for longer than we can possibly imagine. The engineering world and computing have always and will continue to work in tandem with one another, including things like satellite networks and cloud computing.
